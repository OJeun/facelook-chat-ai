# 🧠 FACELook Chat AI – Backend

💬 What is FaceLook? <br>
FaceLook is a real-time group chat application where users can see each other's emotions through expressive emoji reactions — intelligently generated by AI analyzing the conversation. It enhances social interaction by visualizing feelings in a fun, intuitive way.

⚙️ How it Works? <br>
Under the hood, FaceLook runs on a fast and scalable backend powered by Fastify, WebSocket, Redis, and TypeScript.
It supports real-time messaging, AI-powered sentiment analysis via OpenAI, and efficient message buffering through Redis to ensure high performance and reliability.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Real-time WebSocket communication per group
- 🔁 Redis buffering layer for temporary chat storage
- 🧠 OpenAI-powered responses for AI-based interactions
- 🧹 Automatic cleanup and DB dump when all users leave a room
- 🔐 JWT-based authentication-ready
- 🐳 Fully containerized with Docker
---
## 📦 Dockerized Architecture

This backend uses **Docker** and **docker-compose** to manage:

- 🧠 Fastify WebSocket Server
- ⚡ Redis (temporary message storage)
- 🗄️ External database (for persistent chat logs)

### Why Docker?

Using Docker gives us:

- ✅ Consistent environments across dev & production
- 🚀 Easy deployment with `docker-compose up`
- 🧪 Isolated services (backend, RedIs)
- ☁️ Cloud-ready container support (Render, AWS, etc)

## How to start this locally?

🐳 Running with Docker Compose
This project supports running the backend and Redis together using Docker Compose.

📦 Prerequisites <br>
1. Docker & Docker Compose installed

🚀 Steps to Run <br>
2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

```
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in your environment variables in the .env file:


```env
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
DB_API_URL=mysql://mysql:27017/your-database
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
Note: Use redis and mongo as hostnames inside the .env because they are Docker Compose service names.
```



3. Run the app

```
docker-compose up --build
```
This will:
Build and run the backend container (from Dockerfile)

Spin up a Redis container
