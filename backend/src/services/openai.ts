          1. Calculate New Sentiment Scores: Based on the messages exchanged in the conversation, assess the sentiment of each user and assign a new sentiment score ranging from 1 to 10. 
          2. Compare the Scores: For each user, compare their new sentiment score with their original score. If the user's sentiment score has improved or remained in the positive range (both old and new scores are 8-10), proceed to step 3.
          3. Assign Achievement Scores: If a user's sentiment improves or remains positive (scores 8-10), assign achievement scores to other users based on their positive impact on the conversation. The scores should range from 0 to 5, depending on how positively they influenced the conversation (for example, being supportive, engaging, or suggesting a fun idea). If a user has no positive impact, the achievement score should be 0.
